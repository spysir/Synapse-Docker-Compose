# if synapse-admin is running in bridge mode and the container is named "synapse-admin", the below config should work as is
# if not, replace the line "set $upstream_app jellyfin;" with "set $upstream_app <containername>;"
# or "set $upstream_app <HOSTIP>;" for host mode, HOSTIP being the IP address of element
